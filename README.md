# CMS Editor

[![translation-status](https://hosted.weblate.org/widget/axonivy/cms-editor/svg-badge.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/axonivy/)

This repo contains the web-based CMS Editor client.

### Available Scripts

`npm install`: Install all packages

`npm run package`: Build the lib output

`npm run dev`: Start the dev server

#### Run tests

`npm run test`: Run unit tests

`npm run webtest`: Run Playwright tests

### VSCode dev environment

#### Debug

Simply start the `Launch Standalone` or `Launch Standalone Mock` launch config to get debug and breakpoint support.

> [!NOTE]
> The `Launch Standalone` launch config connects to a real engine and therefore requires a running engine on port 8080 with a workspace and project called `cms-test-project`. These attributes can be changed via URL parameters. Execute `./scripts/playwrightInit.sh <path-to-core>` to setup the workspace.

> [!NOTE]
> The `Launch Standalone Mock` launch config only receives mock data and therefore does not work with features for which a real engine is needed (e.g. data validation).

#### Run tests

To run tests you can either start a script above or start Playwright or Vitest with the recommended workspace extensions.
